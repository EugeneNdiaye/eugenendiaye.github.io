			<h1>Short biography</h1>
			<article>
				<p>I have spent my childhood in Senegal where I did my first year of studies that I continue today in 					France. I made my first two years in Mathematics and computer science at the University Paris-Est 					Marne-La-Vall√©e (2010-2012) then I integrated the magistere of Fundamentals Mathematics and 					Applications of the University of Paris-Sud, Orsay (2012-2015) where I obtained my Master's degree in 					Probability and Statistics.
				</p>

				<p>I am mainly interested in Probability, Statistics and Optimization but I remain open to all forms 					of (understandable) Mathematics and sciences :-D.

				<p>You can contact me if you want my resume.
